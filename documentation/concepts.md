# Concepts

There you are again! I've missed you already, we haven't seen each other for a long time. I beg your pardon? You're asking what's behind Arch and an ECS? Then you'd better buckle up.

Arch is an [Entity-Component System](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Entity\_component\_system) (ECS) which is an architectural pattern that favors composition over inheritance. **Entities** are small, unique identifiers, and **Components** are data attached to them. The term **Systems** often refers to the logic that operates on this data.

The world contains all entities that exist in its context. No entity can live outside of this world. Entities can be created individually, in bulk and with predefined data.
